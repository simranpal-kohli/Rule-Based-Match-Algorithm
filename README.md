# Rule-Based-Match-Algorithm
Matching the strings entity with a huge set of data repository with multiple probable suggestions.
The idea of fuzzy logic could also been adopted here but here I intend to build a string matching engine with the combination of
Natural Language Processing (NLTK) & rule based algorithm.

# Steps
Code Files: The Rule based algorithm has found 2 applications as been applied in below two different code files.
1) Manual_Match_Script_V1.6.ipynb
## Description: 

3) NCR_CRT_TARS_Match_V1.ipynb
